# The yoga cluster

## Authentication

We will use github for authentication on JupyterHub. 
Please send us your github account (who should not contain any special character, such as -, _, ., etc) and we'll create a user for you on yoga.

## How to connect and run the notebooks:

- Point your browser to: https://yoga.to.infn.it
- Authenticate through github
  - Open a terminal:
    - git clone https://github.com/leggerf/MLCourse-2021.git
    - cp MLCourse-2021/Notebooks/Day1/* .
  - From JupyterHub Home tab:
    - start and run inputForML_day1.ipynb
