# MLCourse-2021

Material for the course "Big Data Science and Machine Learning" of the academic year 2020-2021 for the Graduate Program in Physics of the 
University of Turin, held on Mar. 8 - 18, 2021. 

## Pre-requisites

- Basic knowledge of python and C or C++

## Before the course starts

- We will be using python, in particular I advise you to get familiar with Jupyter notebooks, numpy and pandas before the course starts. No expert knowledge is required, but doing a couple of tutorials on these topics (easily found on the web) is highly recommended.
- We will use github for authentication on JupyterHub. 
  - Please send us your github account. 
  - The username should not contain any special character, such as -, _, ., etc. 
  - If it does, please create a new account that fulfills the requirements.

## Practicalities

- The course will take place remotely due to COVID restrictions. 
   - We will use [zoom](https://cern.zoom.us/j/405151509)
   - Please try it before the course starts, so that you're setup.
- Every day we will have a mixture of theoretical and hands-on sessions. The last day we will have only hands-on with exercises, which will also be the test for those who needs to get CFU credits.

## Hands-on session

- point your browser to https://yoga.to.infn.it/
- you will need to authenticate through your GitHub account (please read [this](#before-the-course-starts) first)
- on the first day, open a terminal and clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/leggerf/MLCourse-2021.git
```
- The Jupyter notebook documentation can be found [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html)
